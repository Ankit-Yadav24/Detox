# Detox

Detox is an innovative Android application designed to enhance user focus and productivity by curating personalized content from YouTube. By leveraging the YouTube Data API and OAuth 2.0 for user authentication, Detox allows users to filter their YouTube recommendations based on their preferences, creating a tailored viewing experience that promotes learning, growth, and efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Content Curation**: Detox asks users about their content preferences, including topics they want to learn about, skills they want to improve, or hobbies they want to explore. The app then utilizes this information to curate a customized feed of educational, informative, and engaging videos that align with their interests and goals.

- **YouTube Integration**: The app seamlessly integrates with users' YouTube accounts, allowing for real-time updates to their watch history based on the curated content. This ensures that users' YouTube recommendations continue to improve over time, providing them with relevant and valuable content suggestions.

- **Focus Mode**: Users can activate a focus mode that minimizes distractions by limiting access to non-relevant content, helping them stay on track with their goals and avoid the temptation of endless scrolling. The focus mode can be customized based on the user's specific needs, such as setting a timer or blocking certain categories of videos.

- **Dynamic Recommendations**: The app continuously learns from user interactions and feedback, refining content suggestions to ensure they remain relevant and engaging. As users watch videos, rate them, or provide feedback, Detox's algorithms adapt to their preferences, providing an increasingly personalized experience over time.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Detox features an intuitive and clean design, making it easy for users to navigate and find the content they want to watch. The app's interface is optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience on the go.
